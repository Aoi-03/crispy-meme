# 🚚 LogiSwift – AI Route Optimizer for Urban Delivery

*LogiSwift* is a lightweight proof-of-concept web app that demonstrates how AI-assisted route optimization can save delivery teams time and fuel costs.  
It reorders 5–10 delivery stops using the *Google Maps Directions API* with waypoint optimization, visualizing measurable distance and time savings.
